Small example pom.xml for using Maven with Scala.

This is in no way intended to show "how easy" it is. I know that Maven
is complex and ugly, but it's been around forever, and it's just some
part of the Java Environment you need to master.

This should hopefully get you started. It sets up a project which compiles
Java and Scala. It's all based on the scala-maven-plugin, for more
information, see here: http://scala-tools.org/mvnsites/maven-scala-plugin

Besides the standard use of "mvn package" to get your jar, etc, the
plugin also allows you to run a class with

> mvn scala:run -DmainClass=...

and to open a console with the project files in the classpath

> mvn scala:console

It seems this forgets to turn console echo on afterwards. Type "reset" to
reset your console.
